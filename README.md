Welcome to the Kinder APP, a tool designed to help new parents choose the perfect name for their newborn baby. With this app, you can browse through a database of names and vote on the ones you like best.

How it Works
Once you open the app, you'll be presented with a list of names. Simply scroll through the list and tap on the heart icon if you like a name, or the X icon if you don't.

Once you've voted on all the names in the list, you can compare your choices with those of other users. The app will show you which names were most popular overall, as well as which names were most popular among users who voted similarly to you.
